This paper presents approaches to predict the presence of a cap at the pick and place station of a Learning factory. The data used to train and test the models uses the power, current, compressed airflow, energy used at the pick and place station. Results from this paper suggest the methods that could be implemented in large-scale cyber-physical systems to create early warning systems and predict anomalies and designs a framework for insturctional purposes. The paper provides a comparison between the two models and suggests scenarios in which each model is suitable. For both the methods MATLAB toolbox, standard python libraries and machine learning frameworks were used to provide a better comparison between the models.
NOTE: This paper is under construction a lot of the work has not been published yet, please check back later for updates
